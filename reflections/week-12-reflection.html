            <h2>Reflect on your learning activities and experience.</h2>
            <p>
               This week I worked on creating elements with DOM manipulation and adding event listeners. By far my hardest part of my week was getting event listeners
               to work. I couldn't have done it without Brother Thayne's help. I had been researching on the internet for hours, tried multiple strategies, and none of them
               had worked. In the end, it was a lot simpler than most of the strategies I found!
            </p>
            <p>
                It was very exciting to pull the project together and feel like it is finished. Then I asked people to test it for me - and discovered I had broken a lot
                of things when I changed from HTML to DOM manipulation! Fortunately they were all easy fixes. I feel like I really learned a lot this week and not the 
                project actually is done.

            <h2>Consider your openness to new ideas.</h2>
            <p>
                Like every week, I feel like a sponge when it comes to new ideas. There is still a lot to learn. While what I had written with HTML worked fine and was 
                easy, I can see now how there is more control with DOM manipulation.

            <h2>Consider your ability to rationally evaluate options and explain why options are selected.</h2>
            <p>
                This week was a good lesson in evaluating options, because I actually understood a number of options. Taking some time to, once again, think through a
                problem and decide what was best really made the programming easier. It also helped me to decide what NOT to do even when someone suggested I should do it.
                After evaluating it became clear the suggestion wouldn't work well.

            <h2>Reflect on teamwork.</h2>
            <p>
                Since we are all working on our individual projects and no longer have weekly code teaching, our group did not meet at all this week. I have looked at
                both Michelle and John's pages to see if there final projects are there to see yet and they weren't.
            </p>

            <h2>Reflect on your communication abilities. Document your growth as it relates to the course outcome.</h2>
            <p>
                Since we didn't meet as a team, the only person I communicated with this week was Brother Thayne. I set an appointment for Thursday and then set lots of
                alarms to remind me! I wanted to make sure not to miss it. Talking through what wasn't working and what all was required helped me to have a better 
                understanding of what I needed to turn in.
