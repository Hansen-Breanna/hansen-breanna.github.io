            <h2>Reflect on your learning activities and experience.</h2>
            <p>
               This week I was learning about manipulating CSS class properties and JavaScript Events. The class properties was easy to do after discussing them last week
               with Brother Thayne. I see how it is much more concise to use one line of code to change a class than to try to change lots of elements using style. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The events were much harder! I am still not sure if I have done them right. Having never using touch events or listeners before, I 
               spent a lot of time researching and testing code. Learning how to trigger events is going to take a lot more work for me.

            <h2>Consider your openness to new ideas.</h2>
            <p>
                This week felt like getting hit with a fire hose full of new ideas. Finding different ways to do the same thing was interesting. It also made finding
                what I was after much harder. Many involved coding I didn't understood. That was balanced out by the new concepts I found for <code>classList</code> That
                were fairly easy to implement. This week definitely made me appreciate all the code that others put on the internet for other people to learn.

            <h2>Consider your ability to rationally evaluate options and explain why options are selected.</h2>
            <p>
                I am reaching the point where I feel it is hard to evaluate which way is better than another. I've had to do more thinking through logic and writing
                things down before coding. Still, what is chosen generally comes down to what works correctly this first time on occasion. I did end up changing previous
                code after learning about <code>classList</code> as I can see that is a better option for styling.

            <h2>Reflect on teamwork.</h2>
            <p>
                Our team work was fine this week. We let each other know who could make the meeting. Michelle and I discussed ideas for her project, and I also showed her
                a list of API options that she could look through to help decide on a project. It was fun to help her look and start getting ideas.

            <h2>Reflect on your communication abilities. Document your growth as it relates to the course outcome.</h2>
            <p>
                The idea I had to use the spreadsheet to keep track of Zoom links has been very useful. Michelle and I have finished all of our topics. The sheet helps
                us to find the links we need without having to email someone to ask for it or sift through emails.
